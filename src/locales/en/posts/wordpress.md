Every day, more than 50,000 new WordPress sites go online. This impressive statistic deserves careful consideration regarding the role of content management systems (CMS) in today's web ecosystem.

WordPress now powers about 43% of global websites—not just 43% of sites using a CMS, but nearly half of all existing websites. This dominance, even stronger than in 2015 when I initially wrote this article, raises legitimate questions about its systematic appropriateness.

## When to Use a CMS?

Although I've long advocated using content management systems—and still recommend them under specific circumstances—it is essential to be cautious before defaulting to WordPress. Installing a CMS primarily makes sense in two scenarios:

- Content requires regular updates by people without web development skills.
- The site needs complex features such as forms, e-commerce, blogs, membership systems, etc.

For a simple showcase site of a few pages, WordPress may be an oversized solution, although its evolution since 2015, notably with the introduction of the Gutenberg editor, has simplified its usability. Beyond assessing your needs, several critical factors deserve consideration.

## Limitations of WordPress in 2025

### Security

WordPress’s popularity makes it a prime target for cyberattacks. Its inherent vulnerability to security flaws continuously exposes your site to risks, necessitating increased vigilance and regular updates. However, the WordPress team has significantly improved core security in recent years, and several reliable solutions (such as Wordfence, Sucuri, or built-in security features from specialized hosting providers) now substantially mitigate these risks.

### Editing Interface

Since 2018, the Gutenberg editor replaced the older WYSIWYG editor, radically transforming the WordPress editing experience. This block-based approach offers considerable flexibility but also a steep learning curve. For some users, the gap between design and final output has shrunk, while for others, complexity has increased, potentially causing frustration.

### Technical Complexity

Paradoxically, WordPress can complicate otherwise straightforward layout tasks. The system often overloads basic functionality with unnecessary layers of complexity. Emerging ecosystems like Full Site Editing (FSE) and block-based themes gradually improve this situation but temporarily increase complexity for developers and users accustomed to the older system.

### Performance

Loading speed is critical for any website, especially given the increasing importance of Google's Core Web Vitals. The proliferation of files and processes inherent in WordPress can significantly slow down website performance. Fortunately, solutions like advanced caching plugins, CDNs, and optimized WordPress hosting now allow achieving excellent performance with appropriate configuration.

### SEO

While WordPress currently offers a strong foundation for SEO due to its structure and mobile compatibility, relying solely on plugins like Yoast SEO or Rank Math still has limitations. Optimal SEO often requires a more direct, personalized approach beyond the automated suggestions these plugins provide.

## Modern Alternatives to WordPress

The web ecosystem has considerably evolved since 2015, offering appealing new options:

- **Headless CMS**: Platforms such as Strapi, Contentful, or Sanity separate content management from frontend rendering, providing greater flexibility and performance.
- **Static Site Generators**: Next.js, Gatsby, or Astro combined with headless CMS offer excellent performance and enhanced security.
- **SaaS Platforms**: Wix, Squarespace, or Webflow have significantly improved their capabilities for professional websites.

## Necessary Reflection

While WordPress effectively meets certain needs (this site is an example), systematically choosing it requires questioning. Initially designed as a productivity and autonomy tool, it can become a complex technical burden.

Before choosing a CMS, thoroughly analyze your needs. Avoid following trends or promises of complete autonomy. Web development remains a complex discipline not necessarily simplified by CMS tools. Instead, prioritize:

- Collaboration with qualified professionals
- Developing your technical skills
- A tailored approach suited to your actual needs
- Objective evaluation of new available alternatives

The web's increasing importance demands thoughtful technological choices, based on objective need analysis rather than preconceived solutions. In 2025, WordPress remains powerful, but its use should result from conscious choice rather than habit.
