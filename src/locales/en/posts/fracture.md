## A Field Experience

For more than five years, I have regularly facilitated workshops and conferences on different aspects of the Web: digital marketing, e-commerce, social media. These interventions, conducted in collaboration with economic development organizations such as Ressources Entreprise, CLDs, or the Economic Loan Fund, have allowed me to meet hundreds of entrepreneurs in the Quebec region, primarily in the startup phase.

From these numerous exchanges emerge two major observations: the existence of a real digital divide on one hand, and the difficulty entrepreneurs face in evaluating costs related to developing a digital presence on the other.

## The Digital Divide: Beyond Generations

The debate about Web usage often falls into a simplistic generational opposition: young people would naturally be more skilled, seniors hopelessly outdated. This reductive view obscures the essential: the digital divide is not so much based on age as on intellectual curiosity and education level.

My field experience reveals a more nuanced reality:

- Sixty-somethings passionate about digital possibilities
- Young entrepreneurs disoriented by technologies
- Confusion fueled by media myths

For entrepreneurs wishing to develop their digital presence, the challenge is twofold:

- Facing a complex and sometimes opaque range of services
- Sorting fact from fiction in the advice received (free websites, specialized agencies, SEO, social media presence)

The digital ecosystem, in constant mutation, further complicates the situation. Digital primarily represents a new approach to information management: entrepreneurs must therefore become informed to understand the tools, opportunities, and issues. There is no miracle solution – developing a digital presence requires a deep understanding of the digital environment.

## Cost Evaluation: Beyond Apparent Free Services

The question of costs related to developing a digital presence remains particularly thorny for entrepreneurs. The mirage of free services exerts a powerful attraction, particularly in the realm of social networks.

Take the example of a Facebook page:

- Free creation? Yes
- Weekly management: about 5 hours
- Annual impact: more than 250 hours of work

Essential questions to ask:

- Is this time investment relevant?
- How to measure return on investment?
- Would these resources be better employed elsewhere?

Unfortunately, this strategic reflection is often lacking. Many companies improvise their digital presence, celebrating successes without analyzing failures. A paradox emerges: while everyone recognizes the importance of digital, why do so many neglect strategic reflection and necessary investments?

This situation calls for an urgent awareness. Without it, the digital divide risks amplifying, further widening the gap between organizations that master their digital transformation and those who merely endure it.
